Cloud Computing Development Track Day 4 .
-----------------------------------------

CLOUD ESSENTIALS
-----------------

	- Focus on skills to adopt operation and govern cloud computing effectivlly
	- identify the charatersitics of cloud computing from business prespective
	- Explain the relationship between cloud and virtualization
	- identify different types of cloud computing services
	- identity vallue of cloud computing
	- list  the steps to sucsifglly cmputing 
	- identify the organizations capability and how they can move to cloud or not 
 
	Targets:
	--------		
		- Reduce complixity of landscape
		- Improve the availability of service, it is relative to SLA.
		- Working a secure and flexible IT environments to allign with business requirments.

	
	
	- Cloud Service Provider:
	
		provides the access to the software, it take care of hosting and storage and also help 
		developer rapidly create applications. Users have not no clue where their data is
		
	- SPI stands for Software/Platform/Infrastructure services
	
	 cloud set of: 				Cloud service:					cloud service providers responsible for:
			Hardware	 			- software services				- assets
			network		 			- computation resources			- maintenance
			storage		 			- storage services				- operations
			services	 			- Network services
			interfaces

		Cloud is based on the concepts in the other hand virtualiztion based on technologies.
		advantages:
			- Elasticity of usage.
			- Diferent cost model. 
	
	
	Essential characteristics of cloud computing services:
	
		- On-demand slef-service 'automated/scalable services'
		- broad network access
		- Resource pooling 'containers of different resources in large scale'
		- Rapid Elasticity
		- Measured services 


	Differencies between cloud and virtualization:

	Common
		- both sheild hardware
		- multiple users can share same resources
		- flexible deployment of services
	Differences:
		 - virtualization is a technology while cloud is a business concept
		 - virtualization enabling technology in many cloud services
	
	Cloud overcomes problems:
	--------------------------
		- running out of capacity
		- costly and execess capact
		- much capital tied up in server hardware

	Organization would probably not benefit becuase:
	------------------------------------------------
		- steadly large and fixed workloads 
		- organization that owns large datacenter
		- high compliance standards
		- high degree of operational assurance.

	Cloud Service Models:
	---------------------

		- Software as a service (SaaS)
		- platform as a service (PaaS)
		- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
	

	Notes:
	
	Mainframe
	--------- 
			- A server has dummy terminals that have the same concept of thin client.
