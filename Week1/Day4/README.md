Cloud Computing Development Track Day 4 .
-----------------------------------------

#CLOUD ESSENTIALS


	- Focus on skills to adopt operation and govern cloud computing effectivlly
	- identify the charatersitics of cloud computing from business prespective
	- Explain the relationship between cloud and virtualization
	- identify different types of cloud computing services
	- identity vallue of cloud computing
	- list  the steps to sucsifglly cmputing 
	- identify the organizations capability and how they can move to cloud or not 
 
	Targets:
	--------		

		- Reduce complixity of landscape
		- Improve the availability of service, it is relative to SLA.
		- Working a secure and flexible IT environments to allign with business requirments.

	
	
	- Cloud Service Provider:
	
		provides the access to the software, it take care of hosting and storage and also help 
		developer rapidly create applications. Users have not no clue where their data is
		
	- SPI stands for Software/Platform/Infrastructure services
	
	 cloud set of: 				Cloud service:					cloud service providers responsible for:
			Hardware	 			- software services				- assets
			network		 			- computation resources			- maintenance
			storage		 			- storage services				- operations
			services	 			- Network services

		Cloud is based on the concepts in the other hand virtualiztion based on technologies.
		advantages:
			- Elasticity of usage.
			- Diferent cost model. 
	
	
Essential characteristics of cloud computing services:
------------------------------------------------------
	
		- On-demand slef-service 'automated/scalable services'
		- broad network access
		- Resource pooling 'containers of different resources in large scale'
		- Rapid Elasticity
		- Measured services 


	Differencies between cloud and virtualization:

	Common
		- both sheild hardware
		- multiple users can share same resources
		- flexible deployment of services
	Differences:
		 - virtualization is a technology while cloud is a business concept
		 - virtualization enabling technology in many cloud services
	
	Not all virtualization must be used a cloud service 	
	
Cloud overcomes problems:
--------------------------

		- running out of capacity
		- costly and execess capact
		- much capital tied up in server hardware

Organization would probably not benefit becuase:
------------------------------------------------

		- steadly large and fixed workloads 
		- organization that owns large datacenter
		- high compliance standards
		- high degree of operational assurance.

Cloud Service Models:
---------------------

		- Software as a service (SaaS)
		- platform as a service (PaaS)
		- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
	

			SaaS:
					User accounts world-wide access global collaboration subscription based.
			PaaS:
					Rapid Development 'Mashups' intergating multivendor cloud services
			IaaS:
					virtual servers , storage flexible use

Cloud Deployment Models:
-------------------------
	
		- Private Cloud
		- Public Cloud 
		- Hybrid Cloud 
		- Community Cloud



# Business Prespectives:
------------------------

New business promisses
----------------------

		- savings
		- flexibility
		- Agility
		- Greate User Experience.


Cloud Computing and Outsourcing
-------------------------------

	- cloud computing is based on outsource, it is about IT capabilities that are delivered as a service
	  over a network.
Key driver of outsourcing:
--------------------------

				1- on-demand slef-service	63%
				2- broad netowk access		56%
				3- resource pooling			44%
				4- rapid elasticity			23%
				5- Measured service			21%


	- lower cost per server
	- Higher availability
	- faster time to market
	- innovation software solutions
	- innovation platforms
	- reduce in capital expanditure
	
Cloud Computing and outsourcing common features:
------------------------------------------------


							IT services
								|
						---------------------
						|					|
					In-source			Out-Source
											|
								-------------------------
								|						|
							Cloud computing			Traditional Out-source


	1- reasons for adoption 'need more innovation than the current organization can handle'.
	2- External staff					
	3- Provider-owned assets to reduce Exist strategy regulations
	4- Vendor Lock-in potential
	
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								Cloud computing						Outsourcing
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------							
	- Financial Commitment			Shor-Term						Long-Term
	- HW/SW Customization			True							False
	- Scalability of Capacity		Scalable						Not scalable
	- Contract Changes				dynamic							Fixed		
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	

CIO Top Concerns:
-------------------

	1- Cost								49%
	2- Manufacurance					32%
	3- security							25%
	4- user experience					19%
	5- scalability and flexibility		18%
	6- collaboration					18%

CapEx and OpEx:
---------------

	Cloud shifts from CapEx to OpEx

	Capital Exenses: 
			cloud computing derives greater optimization and utilization of IT assets
	Operational Expenses:
			public cloud services are billed to the consumers on a pay per use basis

Maintenance:
-------------
	Three types of maintenance:

		1- Update
		2- Upgrade
		3- Fixes

	Cloud Computing reduces:
		- technology risks to the business.
		- Capital expense tied up in obsolete or superfious hardware
		- staff tied up in legacy maintenance

Security and Risks:
-------------------
	
		"An organisation may have an appetite for some types of risk" 
	
	- availability: this informs you about the status of the service and data avialable when required.
	- Confidentiality: this limits data access to the authorized people 
	- Integrity: this potects tampering of data and is data trustworthy

	 
User Experience:
----------------

	IT applications have business value:
		
		- Web-based user interfaces
		- more recent versions of software
		- access anywhere anytime 
		- easy to use and flexible capacity

Collaborations:
---------------
	
		-------------
		|	Org		| -----------------> Firewall ------VPN---------User / Business partner
		-------------
		
		- remote workers
		- business partners

Scalability:
------------

Capacity planning:
-------------------

		Performance problem							 Costly
				|										|
				|										|
			IaaS Resources		PaaS Resouces		SaaS Resources
	
	Capacity depends on the business demands or business patterns.
