# Module 4 Service Strategy
---------------------------
		1- Service Strategy in Life Cycle:
		
						
	
			
							Service Transition  ---> Service Operation
									|								|
									|		Service Strategy		|
									|								|
			Continual service Imporvement<--------Service Desgin<-----

			Purpose:
			--------
				- to operate and grow in the long term
				- transform service management into strategic asset.
					- Knowledge is some sort of assets
				- relationships between services, systems and processes
				
			Uitility and warranty:
			-----------------------
						
						Utility: 'Matching the purpose of service or product'
						--------
							Fit for puprose ---> The functionality offered by the product
												or service 
						
						
						
						Waranty:
						--------
								Fit for use, promise or gurentee that availability
								capacity and continuity for services and products
								
							--------------------------------------------------------------
									Low Impact on 					High Value
									business outcomers but			with waranty basis
									with high certainty 			High Value
									(Unbalanced value)				with utility basis
							---------------------------------------------------------------		
									Low Value 						High impact on 
									with utility basis				business but with low 
									low value with 					certainty 
									waranty basis
							----------------------------------------------------------------
							
					
			
			Service assets:
			---------------
					service assets are the capability or resources of service provider
					
						Capabilities 					Resource
						----------------------------------------------------
						Management 						finincial capital
						organization					infrastructure
						processes 						applications
						knowledge						information
						poeple relationships			number of employee
						-----------------------------------------------------
			Governance
			-----------
					Ensure that policies and strategy are actually implemented, and that required processes are correctly
					followed 
					
								Evaluate ------> Monitor
									|				|
								Direct<--------------					
								
			Business case:
			--------------
					includes analysis of information that related to  
							- needs
							- solution
							- benfits
							- cost
							- Risk 'uncertinity'(opportiunity and threats)
							- possible problems
			Risk Management:
			----------------
					defined as uncertianty of eather an outcome, negative threat or positive opportunity
						- Risk analysis
								
								list of risks and descuss the impact and propability before risk management
								to decide where is the highest propability with highest impact 
								
								
																|	Propability		
												------------------------------------------
												   Impacts 		|	low | meduim | High
												------------------------------------------
										list	     low 		|	X				
										 of			medium		|			X	
										risks		high		|	X	 
												-------------------------------------------
												
						
						- Risk management
						
						
						
										
														-----opportunity ---->accept
														|				------> ....	
										Risk ----------
														|
														-----Threats---------> avoid
			Types of service providers:
			----------------------------
			
			
				
				
							1- Type 1 --------> Internal service provider
							2- Type 2 --------> Shared service unit
										Service provider (IT)
										---------------------
												|
								--------------------------------
								|								|
							business unit 1						business unit 2
			
							3- Type 3 -------->	Exernal service provider
										
			Partner of business activity

			Principles and models of service strategy
			-----------------------------------------
							
							Service triangle:
							-----------------    /\
												/  \	
											   /    \
										Price /      \ performance
											 /________\
											 Function
							
							characteristics of value:
							-------------------------
								- Value defined by customer 
								- affordable mix of features
							Understanding the value of IT service:
							--------------------------------------
								- service provide value to an organization when valuer of service 
								is higher than the cost of procuring the service 
								 some poeple uses obsolete sw instead of using the sw provided by organization
								 
							 
							
							component of value
							------------------
								- customer perceptions
								- business outcome
								- preferences
							
								- Customer perception of value
								-------------------------------
									- Reference value 'background of customer'
									- Economic value of service =  net difference of (positive diff - negative diff) + reference value
			3 - Processes in service strategy:
			--------------------------------
						1- Processes in service strategy:
						---------------------------------
							- service portfolio management:
							-------------------------------
								- document, description and understand the offered services
								- controling the offered serivces
										
											----------------------------
											Knowledge Management system
											-----------------------------
												Service Portfolio
												------------------
													1- Service pipeline 'future'
													2- service catalogue 'present'
													3- retired service	 'past'
										
										
												Service lifecycle 'attributes' in service catalog:
												--------------------------------------------------
													- service status
													- requirements
													- definition
													- analysis 
													- approved
													- chartered 'initiated'
													- Desgine
													- Development
													- Build
													- test
													- release 
													- Operation/live
													- retiring
													- retired
								
								- Management Information systems and Tools:
										
										Service Pipeline:
											containing details about services that are being 
											initiated for development and deployment
										Service catalogue
										Retired services
									P100
										configuration management Data base track the relations between 
										components of service 
										
								- Business relationship management 
									- to satisfy customer needs 

# Module 5 Service Desgine:
---------------------------

		General Concepts and definitions
		--------------------------------
			- Service Desgin package:
				
					SDP should be produced during the desgin stage for each new service, major change
					to a service, removal of a service or changes to itself
					
					service desgin package:
					- requirement
					- service desgin 
					- organizational readiness assessment
					- service lifecycle plan
					- service operational acceptance plan
					- service acceptance criteria
		
			- Model of service design:
			--------------------------
				Poeple
				products
				partners
				processes
			- five aspects of service design:
			----------------------------------
				- service solution
				- technology and archtecture
				- processes required
				- measurement methods and metrics
				- management information and Tools to manage the '4Ps'
			
			- Technology and management architecture
			
			- Intergated business driven tech management P120
			------------------------------------------------	
							- Business requirement 
				Desgin		- people, roles and activities   		Implementation 
				Top			- processes and procedures					bottom
				Down		- management tools							up
							- technology
			
	
			- Requirments for desgining processes:
			---------------------------------------
			
							Process Model:
							---------------
			
						Process Control					Process					Process Enablers
						---------------					--------				----------------	
						- process policy		<----->	- activities  <---->	- resources
						- objectives			<----->	- metrics	  <---->	- capabilities
						- feedback						- procedures
						- documentation					- roles
						- Process owner					- work instructions
														- imporvment
														
			- Measurements and meterics of process:
			---------------------------------------
						- Progress
						- compliance
						- effciency 
						- correctness
						- effectiviness 
			- Metrics or KPI Tree:
			----------------------
				page 464
				
		Processes of service design:
		----------------------------
			- Desgin Coordination 
					
					ensure that organization meet the goals an objectives of service design 
					by providing and maintaining one coordination and control point 
					for all activities and processes within this stage
					
						- ensure the consistent design 
						- coordinating all design activites across project
			
			- Service Level Management
				
					- make sure that all present and planned IT services are delivered to
					  agreed achievable targets
					- continously negotiating, agreeing , monitoring, reporting and reviewing
					  the IT service targets and achievments
					- Initiating actions to correct or imporve the service level that is delivered
					
					Page 465
			- Most critical interfaces for the SLA
			----------------------------------------
				- business relationship management
				- service catalogue
				- incident management
				- supplier management
				- IT service continuity 
				- financial management 
				- desgin coordination
				
				OLA:
					it is an agreement between ITSP and another part of the same business
				Underbined contract
				-------------------
					between multiple parties 'supplier' + me
				
				SLA frameworks
				---------------
					1- service based SLA
					2- customer based SLA
					3- Multi-level SLAs combination between service and customer SLA 
						- corporate level
						- customer level
						- service level
				
				Service Level requirements: starts from strategy util SLA
				---------------------------
					- specifc service related requirment, translated from business to requirement
					- based on objectives of the business
					- primaly relates to service warranty 
					- satisfy utility specification
					- part of testing phase 
				Service Improvment plan:
				------------------------
							program or plan and it is not a process in SLM, plan prioritized improvement actions 
							for this service 
				
		Service Catalogue Management:
		-----------------------------
					- providing and maintaining constant surce and make sure that service catalogue 
					  available to those who have the authority to access it
				
					- types of service catalogue
					- two view service catalogue
						- business view
						- technical view 
					- three view service catalogue
						- retail service view
						- whole service catalogue view
						- technical view
