		- Change management process:
				authorization of change to modify or change
		- Incident Management
			- There is no standards for compensations
			- No Communication between incidents
		- SLM 'Service Level Managment' represents the level of offered services
		- Request Fulliment:
				- Daily work for service
		- Event Management

		Enablers:
		---------
			- Employees
			- customers
			- advisers
			- technologies
		
		Scenarios:
		----------

	Concept of service:
	-------------------
	
		service a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes customers want to  acheive 
		without the ownership of specific costs and risk. i.e PaaS
		
	
	Services:
	---------
		
			the type of services are devided into internal and external:
				
				internal service 		---> delivered between departments or business units in the same organization
				external service 		---> delivered to external customer
				
	IT services:
	------------
								Customer
									|
							-----------------
							|				|
					core services		Enhancing service
						  |
					-------------------------
					|						|
				Enabling service 	Enabling service		

			- Enabling service is the building block of core services such as databases
			- Enhancing service ...the service enhancment for core services 
			
	Types of customers:
		- internal 
		- external
	
Service Management:
-----------------
		 set of specialized organizational capabilities for providing value to customer in the form of service
										"Quality is No 1"
		 - service management:
		 ---------------------
			- is a professional practice that is globally supported by qualification schemes and standards
			- must transform capabilities and resource into valuable services
			
		- challenges:
		-------------
				- they are intangilble in nature
				- the demand for capability is linked to the assets of customer
				- they involve high of contact for service producers and consumers 
				- service output and capacity are perishable "Meterics of service 'service level agreement'"
		- IT service Management: 
		------------------------
			the implementation and management of quality IT services based on demand 'People + resource + IT infrastructures'
		- Stackholders:
		---------------
		
			- internal stackholder:
					
					functions, teams and groups that deliver the services
			
			- External Stackholder
			
					customers
					users
					suppliers
					
processes and functions:
------------------------
			processes is an input output for set of activities within a specific time
				
				set of Activities
						---> set of procedures
							---> set of work instructions
	
				Applying processes on services
						---------------------------------
						|	S1		| 	S2		| S3	|
				-----------------------------------------
				|	SLM	|			|			|		|
				-----------------------------------------
	
				- down time
				- availability
				- SLA
				- Monitor against SLA and control
				- performance and quality measures
				- Cost of services
				
			Process characterstics:
			-----------------------
				- MSCR 
					- Measurable 
					- Specific results
					- Customers
					- Respond to a specific event 'triggering input for process'
			
				sometimes customer of process is another process 
				
			Process Model:
			---------------
			
						Process Control					Process					Process Enablers
						---------------					--------				----------------	
						- process policy		<----->	- activities  <---->	- resources
						- objectives			<----->	- metrics	  <---->	- capabilities
						- feedback						- procedures
						- documentation					- roles
						- Process owner					- work instructions
														- imporvment
			
			Functions:		Tasks done by daily basis
			-----------
				People + groups + tools they use to perform one or more processes or activities
				
					everyone has a role for specific responisibility inside function 
					
					-  provide structure and stability to organization 
					-  are self-contained units of organization, with their capabilities and resources
					-  Rely on processes for cross-functional coordinating and control
					-  Have their knolwedge base 
				
				
				functions:
				----------	
					- Department "more than one team"
					- Team		"more than one"
					- Group		"people perform similar activities in different organzitational structure"
					- Division "more than one department"
					
				ITIL Functions:
				---------------
						- Service Desk function
							- Help Desk
						- IT technical functions
							- Network 
							- Servers and infrastructures
						- IT Operation function
							- Daily activities that occures in IT 
							- Requests for new mail server.
						- IT Application Function
							- Web dev
							- Administartors
							- Databases

		RACI Metrics
		-------------
			is an example of an authority matrix, which can be used within organization
			to indicate roles and responsiblities in relation processes and activities
			 
			Accountable ----> only one
			Resposible -----> multiple to execute the activity or tasks
			Consulted -------> multiple 
			Informed --------> 
		
		Role:
		------
			a role is the set of responsiblities, activities and authorities defiend in a process and 
			assgined t a person in a team "applied on multiple persons"
			
		
		Service Owner: is responsible for service and enabling services for this service
		process Owner: is responsible for activities of process 
		
		Process Manager Owner:
		----------------------
			- Managing the operations of process
			- may be the process owner 
			- Manage multiple process practioner "responsible for steps in process"

Module 3 Service Life Cycle:
-----------------------------


		- Service Strategy 'demand management' demand is allgined with business objectives
		- service Desgin
		- Service Transition
		- Service Operation
		- Service Improvement
	
	
		- Service strategy:
		-------------------
			- stragic assets and organizational capabilities
			- demand management
			
		service strategy processes:
		---------------------------
			1- strategy management for IT services
			2- Demand Management
			3- service portfolio management
			4- financial Management for IT Service
			5- Business Relationship Management
			6- Business continuity management 
		
		Service Desgin:
		----------------
			1- Desgin coordination ---> introduce service desgin package
			2- Service level management (SLM)
			3- Service Catalogue management 'services descriptions'
			4- Availability Managemnt
			5- Information security management (ISM)
			6- Supplier Management 
			7- capacity management 'available until the agreed level to satisfy the SLA' 
			8- IT services continuity (ITSCM) that alligned with Business cont. management
			
		Value:
			reduced costs
			improved service 
			easier implementation 
			improve performance of service
			
			
		Service Transition processes:
		-----------------------------
			- Change manegement
			- service assset 'enabling services + components of HW' and configuration management 'cosistency between desgine and implementation'
			- knowledge management	'experience'
			- release and deployment management 'plan for replacing releases and deployments'
			- transition planning and support	
			
			another Service transition processes:
			-----------------------------
				- service validation and testing 
				- change evaluation
			
			Purpose:
			--------
				make sure that new, modified or retired service meet the business expectations
			Value:
			------
				Estimation of cost, timing, resources, requistes, and risk factors
				- re-utilization of service transition assets
				- control f service assset and configuration
				- reduction of delay
				- rise in expectaion of stackholders
				- maintenence of new or change services
				
		
		Service Opetations processes:
		-----------------------------
			- Incident management
			- problem management
			- event management
			- request fulfilment
			- access management
			
		Service operations functions:
		----------------------------

		Continual Service Improvment:
		-----------------------------
			CSI methods and Techniques:
			---------------------------
				1- Return on investment
