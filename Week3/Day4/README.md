		Availability Management:
		------------------------
				to check that the service meet the agreed level according to SLA at specific budget
				within time
				- meet both the current and future business requirment
					- defining 
					- planning
					- analyzing
					- measuring and improving 
					
				- provide a focal and management point for all issues related to availability
				
				
				Key elements of avialability:
				-----------------------------
					1- Reactive activities:
							monitoring and measuring related to unavialability events , incident, problems 
					2- proactive activities:
							imporving avaialability by using backup,..etc.
							
				Availability Management information system:
				-------------------------------------------
				
				- Sevice and component availability: p 153
				
				Avialability terms:
					- Reliability
					- Maintainability
					- Serviceability terms
					- performance
					- security 
					- vital business function
					
		- Information security management:
		-----------------------------------
			
				Ensure the following aspects for organization assets:
					- confidentiality 
					- Integrity 
					- avaibility
					
				Objectives:
				-------------
					protect an maintaing the confidentiality of data 
					
				Security Management infrmation system:
				--------------------------------------
					- Information security policy ---> password policy 
													--> access, network policies
					- Security Reports and information
					- Security controls
					- Security Risks and responses
				
			
					"types of policies page 159"
					
		- Supplier Management:
		----------------------
			- Obtain value for money from suppliers
			- provide continous quality of IT service to the business by making sure that all 
			  suppliers contracts and agreement support business requirments and meet contractual 
			  commetments
			
				Supplier management process Page 161
			
			- Categories of Suppliers:
			--------------------------
				- Strategic suppliers 	---> partnerships
				- Tactical suppliers  	---> daily contact and performance reviews  
				- Operational suppliers ---> outsourcing some sort of operational supplier
				- commodity suppliers  	---> low-value products or services
				
				
		- Capacity Management:
		----------------------
			- Make sure that you can scale out/in based on your business needs
			 to meet the required capacity and performance needs in a cost effective 
			 and timely manner 
					
					planned according to concurrent requests for this service  

			- Capacity Plan:
			-----------------
				by analyzing information contained within Capacity Management information system
				
					- Capacity performance report
					- forecasts
					- capacity plan
				- is used to make decisions
				Capacity Service sub-processes:
				--------------------------------
					- Business capacity management
					- components capacity management 
					- service capacity management
				

		- IT service continuity management:
		-----------------------------------
				it is related to business continuity by 
					- reducing the risk to IT services "risk management" 
					- plan and praper for the recoveryof IT services "Risk analysis"
				BIA Business Impact anaylysis:
				------------------------------
					- Hard Impact:
						it is precisly identified ---> financial loss
					- Soft Impact:
						 it is not identifiable easily, ---> public relations, morale, health, and saftey or loss of competitive
						 advanatages
				
				Risk assesments:
				----------------
						- technique to identify threats and risks
						- used to reduce risks to an acceptable level or mitigate the ris
						- determine correct responeses
						- minizing chance of normal operation incidents
						- avaialability management that needed to satisy the availability and reliability levels

# Module 6 Service Transition:
-------------------------------

		topics
		1- change management
		2- service asset and configuration management
		3- release and deployment management
		4- transition planning and support
		5- knowledge management 
		
			1 Change Management:
			--------------------
				- control the lifecycle of all changes allowing valuable changees to be made with least interruption 
				to IT services.
				
				- How to manage the change in configurable item in components of service
				- make sure that all organization record all configuration item (CI) changes in the configuration 
				management system (CMS)
					
				change:
						the addition, modificatoin, removal of anything that could have 
						an affect on the IT service
				
				service change:
				---------------
					- change to an existing service or the intorductin of a new service
					- the addition modification or removal of an authorize, planned r supported 
					service or service components and its associated documentaion
				
				Change Proposal:
				----------------
						requires:
							1- high level description 
							2- full business case including risks, issues 
							- outline schedule for desgin and implementation of the change
				Change Request (RFC):
				---------------------
						Types of change request:
							1- RFC document
							2- service desck call
							3- project initiate document
				Types of changes:
				----------------
						- Standard change 
								'preauthorized change already known, reported and expected change with clear procedures'
						- Normal change 
								'not pre-authorized change '
						- Emergency Change 
								'not pre-authorized change '
							
						CAB and ECAB 
						--------------
							Change authorized board:
									i.e Normal change
							Emeregency Change authorized board
									i.e Normal change wih time limitations 
				Change Model:
				--------------
						application with specific workflow or document and divided into steps to be taken 
						and sequential orders, authorities, duration , thresholdins for action completion
				
				Remedation planning:
				--------------------
						actions taken to recover the first state 'plan B'
				
				Change managment interfaces:
				----------------------------
					- interface with all processes 
					page 194
				Standard change:
				----------------
				
						Role				Create RFC
												|
						Initiator			implement change
												|
						change 			review and close change 
						Management			  record
												|
											close

				Lifecycle of Normal change:
				---------------------------

	2- Service asset and configuration management (SACM):
	---------------------------------------------------- 
		
		- Ensure the correct information about assets in organization
		- it is used to idnetify and control of assets
		- Any new configuration after the baseline, will need a Change request
		- Auditing the design and requirment documents 
		
		
			Configuration Item (CI):
		
				- it is a service asset that needs to be managed
					- service lifcycle CI		i.e service design package SDP, Business case  
					- Service CI				i.e processes, infrastructure
					- organization CI			i.e Business strategy, regulatory requirement
					- Internal CI				....
					- External CI 
					- Interfance CI
			Configuration management system page (467)
			
			Definitive Media library (DML):
			------------------------ ---------
				DB in service knowledge management system where contains some releases for specific configuration
				
	3- Release and Deployment Management:
	-------------------------------------
			
			- planning
			- scheduling
			- controlling
			- testing
			- deployment of release
			
			Phases of release and deployment management:
			--------------------------------------------
			You have to authorize from change management before the following release processes
				1- Authorize release planning
				2- Authorize build and test
				3- Authorize check-in to DML
				4- Authorize Deployment/Transer/retirment
				5- implementation review
				
	4- Transition planning and support 
	----------------------------------
		
		offeres complete planning for service transition and manage resources need where interacting with change, operation, design 
		management services
	
	5- Knowledge management:
	------------------------
		- sharing prepective, ideas, experience, and information
		- leason learned
		- minizing need to rediscover knowledge
